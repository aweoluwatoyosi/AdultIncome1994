## Problem Statement

This dashboard analyses the adult income in the year 1994 of the male and female gender by race, capital gain and loss, country, final weight (census), age. 
 


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : I got the dataset from an online site and cleaned up the dataset and also put the appropriate names for the different columns. I then loaded the data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file. I first cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate cells, trimmed the cells, formatted the colunms to the right data type, removed blank cells
- Step 2 : I started the visualization by putting in card visualization into rectanglar shapes and representing it by capital gain, capital loss, final weight(census) and country.
- Step 3 : I used a slicer for the gender visualization, age, race and country.
- Step 4 : Clustered bar chart was used to represent the marital status and the hours they work per week.
- Step 5 : For the capital gain, I used the color gradient to represent the minimum(red), mid which is the average and maximum (green).
- Step 6 : For the capital loss, I used the color gradient to represent the minimum(red), mid which is the average and maximum (green).
- Step 7 : The different countries were represented with a color from their flag.
- Step 8 : The donut chart was used to represent the income more than 50k and less than 50k
- Step 9 : I added a map to show the different countries and their locations and also used colors to represent them too.
- Step 10: I put a reset button at the bottom to reset (ctrl + click) it to it's original form after the data has been explored
          

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.
I attached the cleaned data of the data
